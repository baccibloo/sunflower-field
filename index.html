<p> Summer, school break, and other forms of long vacations are often held by people as the times where some of their most cherished and memorable childhood memories happened, with mundane experiences often turning into little treasures we all carry into adulthood. The romanticism of summer often comes from the idea of spending unique moments with cherished people, which makes explains why is it that so often the season serves as the setting for magical coming-of-age stories, though this is not this game’s case, at all. Twenty years ago, <i>Millenium Kitchen</i> (a small development team led by Kazu Ayabe) stripped the youthfulness of summer from the fantastic flair often associated with it, trying instead to capture the stillness of this season into a game where the sense of adventure came from making a meaningful story out of a handful of simple activities that involve a small cast of endearing characters in a reduced but magical setting.

As a celebration of this game’s uniqueness and its impact it on me, and to commemorate its aforementioned twentieth anniversary, I’ve put together this little website, a homage to some of the things I treasure the most about it. </p>
