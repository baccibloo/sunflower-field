<h3> About </h3>

<p> I’m Bacci and if you know me (which is likely if you’re here) chances are you also know how attached to the Boku no Natsuyasumi franchise I am. Over the past years, I’ve not only liveblogged my playthroughs of several of the series’ titles while trying to mimic the passing of time in the real world (this is, playing each day of the games’ virtual august matching their real-life counterpart), but I’ve also written several posts about the game, and I even wrote and designed a little zine for it! Now, in the face of the series 20th anniversary, I’ve decided, with the help of several friends, to put together this little site that celebrates the things I cherish the most about this little game. </p></div>
