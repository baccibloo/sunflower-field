<h1> August 32nd </h1> 
<div id="MainPage">

<p>Probably one of the most discussed things amongst fans of the game, despite not being an actually intended feature, the August 32nd bug involves “tricking” the game into loading states for already finished months, which makes the calendar move forward into days not fully programmed, resulting in a mess of areas that don’t transition into each other and in character models that constantly glitch. Though boundary breaking and model glitches are far from an issue exclusive to this videogame, seeing such a mundane setting gradually break apart feels eerier when put into the context of this lighthearted, slice of life game. The idea of seeing the house where Boku spent a big part of his summer into a barren place that leads nowhere has an almost horror-like element to it, almost as if the game was trying to punish you for trying to extend your summer vacation beyond its intended month.
