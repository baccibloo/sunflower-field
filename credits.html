The Boku no Natsuyasumi series, its characters, setting, music, and all of the assets here presented all belong to Sony Computer Entertainment and to Millennium Kitchen, who are to be thanked for putting all their effort into developing this unique gem of a game and its following sequels. To Kaz Ayabe, Mikeo Ueda, Akiko Ukao, and everyone involved in the creation of this game, thank you so much.

As for personal acknowledgements, I would like to thank Kero for planting this idea on my head, it ended up being one of the most challenging things I’ve ever done, but I’m happy I followed your suggestion. To Rogy, thank you so much for your help with the images, and for the input on little things. Finally, I would like to thank Nyandroid, who not only was there to explain every single thing about web design to me, but also saw me fumble every little line of code in every possible way. This literally wouldn’t have been possible without your guidance through the entire thing so, for the millionth time, thank you!
